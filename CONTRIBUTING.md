# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome! Here are some guidelines.

- Try to provide an actionable TL;DR as a description, quoting the original text if you need so.

- First level sections are volontarily not in the alphabetical order: this
list provides a progression to help with the transition to management.

- The rough order is like so:

  1. At first we'll find content appeling to software develpers or new managers. We're reaching for accessibility and targets the wider audience and provide a gentle introduction.
  1. Then we can have a couple of real use-cases or anecdotes, which makes the topic more practical.
  1. Third we might add a couple of reference material to generalize concepts, or provide generic solution or broader thinking frameworks.
  1. At the end we'll add the moast cynical or bleak content, because hey, we can't help it, at what point things might get ugly in toxic environments. And these content might still have utility as cautionary tales or counter-examples.
