# üëî Awesome Engineering Team Management

A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions, industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last few years while transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager. And later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right?  ò‚Äø ò).

It is on this substrate that I crafted my management style, as I found anchoring the later with [the usual labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_style#Types_of_management_styles) is way too limiting and short-sighted. Limiting as management is both of an art and a science. And short-sighted as a style shouldn't be taken at face-value and always be sensible to our fellow humans talents and the business context of the company.

## Engineering to Management Transition

The first step. The hardest: how to requalify oneself from an Individual Contributior (IC) to a front-line manager.

* You always been a developer. Being offered [a management position is not a promotion. It is a change in career](https://fractio.nl/2014/09/19/not-a-promotion-a-career-change/).
* [17 Reasons not to be a Manager](https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/) - An article to [discourage the faint-hearted recruits](https://youtu.be/b07887ZzKiw?t=40).
* [Advice to new managers](https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/966125964861280256) - 9 fundamental principles of the behavior required to be a great manager.
* [Going from Developer to Manager. What should I know or learn?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18823616)
* [How to be a Manager ‚Äì A step-by-step guide to leading a team](https://getweeklyupdate.com/manager-guide) - A full, detailed guide on modern management practices.
* [On being an Engineering Manager](https://ruiper.es/2018/01/15/on-being-an-engineering-manager/) - Some of these points needs nuance, but others are a good taste of things to come for first-time managers.
* [Responsibility vs. accountability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21892816) - The biggest difference between manager (accountable) and engineers (responsible): `‚ÄúBad things‚Äù happen for the person accountable, whereas the person responsible can move on to the next project.`.
* `It is a job where your goal is to try disappoint people most slowly.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18222488)).


## Building Teams

Whether you inherit an already existing team or have to start from scratch, you'll need to practice the art of building (and consolidating) them.

* [Building and Motivating Engineering Teams](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/11/building-and-motivating-engineering.html) - What DO engineers want? Money, purpose and respect.
* [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - `The practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.`.

* [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article `would be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.`.


## Roles

On the profiles, attitude, behaviors, and expectations between developers, managers and executives.

### Executives

Executives are the senior/highest management layers of a company. They reports to a board of directors in bigger companies, or directly to the shareholders in smaller ones. Leadership is expected at this level. As a manager these are the people you report to.

* [What do executives do, anyway?](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926) - Paraphrasing [Andy Grove's book, High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679762884), `the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.`. The article also details the failures modes of a CEO: forcing his own decisions downstreams, or various ways of not resolving conflicts.
* [Executives ratify decisions made on the spot](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1088001688722644992) - Refines the concept above adapting [Tolstoy's thesis to business](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18089716).

Answering the two-part question: What business are we in and what business are we not in? 3. Balancing sufficient yield in the present with necessary investment in the future; 4. Shaping the values and standards of the organization.`.
* [How CEOs Manage Time](https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-leaders-calendar) - A study on what CEO of large companies spent their time on, and how. Opens a new window into what leadership is all about and into its many components and dimensions.
* [Operations and Internal Communication Strategies For Effective CEOs](https://www.sametab.com/blog/operations-and-internal-communication-strategies-for-effective-ceos) - After insisting on the importance of context and narratives, the author provide an interesting template (good for inspiration) of ritual and recurring internal communication devices.
* [Narcissistic CEOs Weaken Collaboration and Integrity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/narcissistic-ceos-weaken-collaboration-integrity) - `The prototypic visionary leader profile is so similar to that of a narcissist, if boards aren't careful, they‚Äôre going to end up choosing people who are narcissistic as CEOs`.
* `Hiring isn‚Äôt the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.` ([source](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).

### Managers

* [What are the signs that you have a great manager?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20230133) - `The irony is that you don't really notice a great manager.`
* [Identify what makes a great manager](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager/steps/learn-about-googles-manager-research/) - Google tried to prove managers don't matter. Instead, it discovered [10 Traits of the Very Best Ones](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/google-tried-to-prove-managers-dont-matter-instead-they-discovered-10-traits-of-very-best-ones.html).
* `Over the years we have developed the policy that it is important for the supervisor to thoroughly know and understand the work of his group.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20683609)) - Echoes articles above, that quote is [from David Packard](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/0060845791) (HP co-founder), decades before current [management fad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_fad).
* [As a product manager, how do you earn the respect and trust of your team?](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1124938723093766144)

### Engineers

* [7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer](https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/) - TL;DR: `1. I‚Äôm a senior developer; 2. Everyone writes tests; 3. We‚Äôre so far behind everyone else (a.k.a. tech FOMO); 4. Code quality matters most; 5. Everything must be documented; 6. Technical debt is bad; 7. Seniority means being the best at programming`.

* [Technical Debt Is Like Tetris](https://medium.com/s/story/technical-debt-is-like-tetris-168f64d8b700) - Another way to explain technical debt: `Scenarios like these create technical debt within the product code. A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (‚Ä¶) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.`.

### Consultants

* `A consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).
* `The value that most orgs get from a consultant (‚Ä¶) is the political cover to make changes they knew they should make all along, but didn't have the social capital or the focus to make those changes` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714791)). And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.


## Recruitment

To combat IPL, you might introduce random unknowns to supress any attempt to game the system toward the object of your desire. I.e. avoid to cheat yourself to success.
* `People who excel at software design become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.` - A reminder of the needs of humility and recognition of limits in our industry, [from a panel on the Moral Economy of Tech](https://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm).

Still, google engineers already practice a culture close to what looks like the 10-points Agile manifesto. But that it.

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

KPIs are a set of quantitative measurements at the team or organizational level, to measure the sucess of the business.

* `Numerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.` - [W. Edwards Deming](https://quotes.deming.org/authors/W._Edwards_Deming/quote/2068-2)
* [SRE fundamentals: SLIs, SLAs and SLOs](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos.html) - If you are in the business of cloud services, these metrics are certainly great KPIs.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

OKRs are a framework. Extending KPIs, they applies individually to each members of an organization, down to the IC level. Everyone is supposed to have its own set of OKRs.

* [OKRs from a development team‚Äôs perspective](https://zafulabs.com/2019/05/24/okrs-from-a-development-teams-perspective/) - On how OKRs articulates with a backlog.

## Literacy

It is not only about reading and writing. It encompass all the social practice, context sharing and communication surrounding the activity and production of a team.  

Especially a software team, wich will generate a huge amount of knowledge. All this knowledge is fragile and about to be lost for good. Unless you materialization it in the form of writing.

### Knowledge

On knowledge surrounding a team.

* [You‚Äôre Not Managing a Team of Software Engineers, You‚Äôre Managing a Team of Writers](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/youre-not-managing-a-team-of-software-engineers-you-re-managing-a-team-of-writers-b263d3a10cc7).

It generally takes the form of a document providing an overview of the expected severe failures and a set of procedures on how the system and the team operating it is prepared to deal with. The one linked here is a great example of such document, and is strong evidence the team is prepared for the worse.

### Writing

General advices on how to convey meaning and clarity by nastering the style. If badly written, your documentation is likely to have poor usage and utility.

In practice, it‚Äôs often more complicated than that.
* `Since managers are not tied to a sector (in the way nurses or musicians are), the good ones tend to go where they are payed good money and the bad ones end up wreaking havoc where they are payed at least some money. That, also, is `[Baumol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease)` in action.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20448929)).

## Politics

Here we are, at the intersection of power and influence lies the political game. If its nature and intensity is sourced from the company's core culture and history, you're unfortunately unlikely to avoid it past a certain hierarchical level. So be prepared.

* [HiPPO FAQ](http://bitly.com/HIPPOExplained) - HiPPO stands for `Highest Paid Person's Opinion`, a trait of dysfunctional culture, in which power politics trumps data.
* [*The Prince*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) - Machiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honour and power as a leader. Resorting to that level of politics in a company is a sure way to render the culture highly toxic, as well as corrupting and demoralizing the organization at all levels.

* `"You know your game fails when you read in the news about the feature you are supposed to have".` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20220484)). A team learning about its roadmap at the same time of the general public is a sure sign something is wrong.


## Re-organizations

* `If you have dealt with large, completely incompetent organizations and wondered how the hell they actually keep going - theres your answer. If built correctly it's genuinely difficult to mess things up.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20533922)). I.e. the structure of the organization is quintessential to its longevity.

* `This is the managerialist dream. To replace employees' judgement and competence with a process and management methodology. (‚Ä¶) It never works.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20881308)). And why the retraining answer above is the best one.
* [An Alternative Approach to Re-Orgs At Your Company](https://caseyaccidental.com/alternative-approach-re-orgs/) - `Trying not to repeat re-org mistakes, we started working on a structure that would make the re-org act like a feedback-fueled progress driven by the teams instead of by people above them.`. This is an attempt to extract from the ground up signals pointing to inadequate structure. My cautionary tale: this might only work up to a point depending on the company's culture.
* `When everything is great success, people behind that success shadow the people who could make success in the future. (‚Ä¶) Netflix is great example of how to do big transition right. Netflix was in renting DVDs by mail business. When the decision to move to streaming was made, Netflix CEO did not allow managers who responsible for DVD renting business into meetings where the future was planned.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21395557)).

Not the other way around. `Changes at the top ‚Äî not speeches, training or hashtags ‚Äî make the most cultural impact. If you want real and lasting cultural change, sweep away the made-men who succeeded under the previous culture and promote the people who look, act, and think more like their employees than their managers.`
* [How the Digg team was acquihired](https://lethain.com/digg-acquihire/) - Acqui-hire of a whole team can be seen as a type  of reorg. In which managers will have to negotiate the new employment contracts in bulk in one or two days: `Because acquihires are ‚Äústar‚Äù oriented, if you‚Äôre a senior leaders who doesn‚Äôt explicitly refuse to move forward, pressure will converge on you from all sides`.
